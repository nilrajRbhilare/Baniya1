Build a complete, modern, professional frontend for a full Billing + Inventory + Accounting application. Take UI/UX inspiration from apps like Vyapar, myBillBook, Zoho Books, TallyPrime, Marg ERP, BUSY Accounting, and Khatabook.
The frontend should be responsive, minimal, fast, and business-oriented. Use clean typography, a sidebar layout, and neatly spaced UI components with cards, tables, and modals.
Generate the entire React frontend structure, pages, components, routing, state management, reusable UI elements, forms, tables, validation, and sample mock data.
